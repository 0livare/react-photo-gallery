# photoswipe-react

A React wrapper for the [PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe) library.

It currently does not allow for a custom implementation of the grid of photos because I think in order to make this work, I will have to implement React context to pass the `openPhotoswipe()` prop down.
